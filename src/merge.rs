//! Join complexity data (per-function) with coverage data (per-file) into
//! CRAP entries.
//!
//! ## The path-matching problem
//!
//! This is where the silent failure mode lives. The complexity pass gives
//! us absolute paths (whatever was passed to `analyze_tree`). LCOV files
//! can contain:
//!
//! 1. **Absolute paths**  — `/home/alice/project/src/foo.rs`
//! 2. **Workspace-relative paths** — `src/foo.rs`
//! 3. **Crate-relative paths in a workspace** — `crates/core/src/foo.rs`
//! 4. **Paths with `./` or `../` components** — `./src/foo.rs`
//!
//! `cargo llvm-cov` by default emits workspace-relative paths. `cargo tarpaulin`
//! emits absolute paths. CI systems with symlinked or containerized
//! checkouts mix both. A naïve `HashMap<PathBuf, _>` lookup will silently
//! return `None` for 100% of files and report every function as "0%
//! covered" — which is exactly the class of bug where a green CI suddenly
//! starts red-lining a whole codebase.
//!
//! Our strategy: build a lookup keyed on **canonicalized suffix matches**.
//! For every coverage path we can't canonicalize (because it's relative),
//! we try progressively shorter suffixes against canonical complexity paths.
